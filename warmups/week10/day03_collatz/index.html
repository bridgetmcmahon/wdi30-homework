  <h1>The Collatz conjecture</h1>

  <p>The Collatz conjecture is a conjecture in mathematics named after Lothar Collatz, who first proposed it in 1937.</p>
  <p>It's also known as the 3n + 1 conjecture, the Ulam conjecture, the Kakutani's problem, the Thwaites conjecture,</p>
  <p>Hasse's problem or the Syracuse problem, the sequence of numbers that results is referred to as the hailstone numbers or
  the wondrous numbers.</p>
  <br/>
  <p><strong>The problem is defined as follows:</strong></p>

  <code>Take any positive integer n. If n is even, divide it by 2 to get n / 2.
  <br/>
  If n is odd, multiply it by 3 and add 1 to obtain 3n + 1.
  Repeat the process indefinitely.</code>
  <br/>
  <p>The conjecture is that no matter what number you start with, you will always eventually reach 1.</p>
  <br/>
  <h2>Task</h2>

  <p>Write a program that given a number, verifies this conjecture for all positive numbers greater than one.</p>
  <p>Ideally your program will output when it has completed, how many cycles it ran for and all the steps it took to reach the end.</p>

  <p>Examples to verify your program can be found on the [wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collatz_conjecture).</p>
