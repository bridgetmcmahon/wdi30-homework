  <h1>Prime Factors</h1>


  <p>A [prime number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_number) is any number greater than one that is only divisible by itself.</p>

  <ul>
  <li>1 is not a prime number (it is not greater than 1).</li>
  <li>2 is a prime number (it is greater than one and is only evenly divisible by itself and 1).</li>
  <li>3 is a prime number (as above).</li>
  <li>4 is not a prime number (it is evenly divisible by 2).</li>
  </ul>

  <p>The [prime factors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_factor) of an integer are the set of prime numbers that will divide the integer exactly.</p>

  <h2>Example</h2>

  <p>What are the prime factors of 60?</p>
  <ul>
  <li>1 is not a prime number.</li>
  <li>2 is a prime number. 60 is evenly divisible by 2 (therefore **2** is a prime factor of 60), and leaves 30.</li>
  <li>30 is evenly divisible by 2 (therefore **2** is a prime factor of 60), and leaves 15</li>
  <li>15 is not evenly divisible by 2.</li>
  <li>3 is the next prime number. 15 is evenly divisible by 3 (therefore **3** is a prime factor of 60), and leaves 5.</li>
  <li>4 is not a prime number.</li>
  <li>5 is a prime number. 5 is evenly divisible by 5 (therefore **5** is a prime factor of 60), and leaves 1.</li>
  <li>When we get to 1, we're done.</li>
  <li>The prime factors of 60 are **2, 2, 3, 5**</li>
  </ul>

  <p>You can check this yourself:</p>
  <ul>
  <li> 2 * 2 * 3 * 5</li>
  <li>= 4 * 15</li>
  <li>= 60</li>
  <li>Success!</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>YOUR TASK</h2>

  <p>Write a function in Javascript which takes a number as its argument and returns an array containing the prime factors of that number.</p>
